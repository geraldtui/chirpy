### [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

An extremely powerful app for note taking, documentation, managing projects and so much more. 

Use it to manage your content such as blog posts, reading lists etc.. 

### [Super](https://www.super.so/)

An intuitive platform that will take your Notion pages and turn them into a fully functional website. 

Use it to manage your websites styling, colours, access etc.. 

# Getting Started With Notion

1. Signup for a **Notion** account here 👉  [https://www.notion.so/signup](https://www.notion.so/signup) 
2. Create a new private page by clicking on the “+” icon found in the Private section on the left panel
3. Type **“Hello World”** for the title and **“This is my first Notion + Super website”** for the first line

It should look something like this:

4. Share the page to the web by clicking on **“Share”** on the top right

Here’s where you’ll find the link which will come in handy when setting up your website on **Super**

5. Congratulations! You’ve successfully created your first **Notion** page. Now it’s time to convert it into a fully functional website using **Super**

# Getting Started With Super

1. Signup for a **Super** account here 👉 [https://app.super.so/signup](https://app.super.so/signup)

6. Once your site gets, you’ll notice that Notion has given you a random domain name. I got “raw-rhinoceros.super.site”

7. You can change this by clicking on “Domains” 

8. Change and save it to a unique domain

9. Congratulations! You’ve just created a website simply by creating a Notion page for your content and Super to hose your website. 

# Whats next?

We’ve only just seen a small glimpse of the power that this **Notion** + **Super** combo can give us. The possibilities are endless because **Notion** is such a powerful tool for organising content and **Super** is an easy to use platform for managing and publishing Notion content into a fully functional website. 

Take some time to get familiar with both Notion and Super interfaces. In my next post we will go over how to use this combo to create a super minimal digital garden just like the one you’re in now (pun intended 😉).
